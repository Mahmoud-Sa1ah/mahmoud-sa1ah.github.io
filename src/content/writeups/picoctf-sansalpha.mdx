How Wildcards Revealed the Hidden Flag in picoCTF’s SansAlpha. CTF challenges often hide their difficulty behind simple constraints. In this picoCTF puzzle, the twist was brutally simple: your keyboard “loses” all alphabet letters.


**Challenge Description:**
The Multiverse is within your grasp! Unfortunately, the server that contains the secrets of the multiverse is in a universe where keyboards only have numbers and (most) symbols.

```bash
ssh -p <port> ctf-player@mimas.picoctf.net
# Use password: password
```

<h2 className="text-3xl md:text-4xl font-extrabold mt-12 mb-6 text-foreground">Step 2 — Initial Exploration</h2>

Once logged in, I realized immediately that I couldn’t type a single alphabetic character. That means:
- No `ls`
- No `cat`
- No `cd`
- No `chmod`
- Not even `/bin/` explicitly because I can’t type “bin”

The shell accepts only numbers and symbols, so I had to rely entirely on wildcards. This is where the challenge really begins.

<h2 className="text-3xl md:text-4xl font-extrabold mt-12 mb-6 text-foreground">Step 3 — Using Wildcards to Navigate</h2>

Bash wildcard patterns still work, even without typing letters. The ones I used the most were:
- `*` – matches zero or more characters
- `?` – matches exactly one character
- `[ ]` – matches a character from a set or range
- `[! ]` – matches anything not in the set

I started by listing files in the current directory with:
```bash
./*
```

The system only prints one match at a time, unlike a normal shell, so it wasn’t exactly friendly. Most files gave permission denied, but the key was understanding what paths even exist.

I found a path `!`, so I tried to go deeper. The path to the flag `!`, but I can’t open the file.

<h2 className="text-3xl md:text-4xl font-extrabold mt-12 mb-6 text-foreground">Step 4 — Searching From Root</h2>

Since I couldn’t rely on any known commands, I switched to scanning directories from root using only `?` characters:

```bash
/*/*/*
```

Using this approach, I discovered the complete path to the flag file: `/home/ctf-player/blargh/flag.txt`, which shows that we are currently inside `/home/ctf-player`. However, as expected, trying to open the file directly didn’t work because of the permission denied error.

<h2 className="text-3xl md:text-4xl font-extrabold mt-12 mb-6 text-foreground">Step 5 — Finding Useful Binaries</h2>

I then focused on `/bin/`, since it holds key system binaries like `ls`, `cat`, and `chmod`. Most of the commands there didn’t help for this challenge, except for `/bin/base64`, which also matches the hint given.

I attempted to run: 
```bash
/bin/base64 /home/ctf-player/blargh/flag.txt
```
hoping it would output the flag encoded in Base64.

**But the problem?**
I can’t type “base64”. And using `/???/??????` matched multiple files, including unwanted ones like `/bin/base32` and `/bin/x86_64`. This caused the shell to run the wrong binary or treat arguments incorrectly.

I used: 
```bash
/???/????64
```
But `/bin/x86_64` still matched because of the underscore. To exclude the underscore, I refined the pattern:

```bash
/???/[!_]???64
```

This removes matches with `_` in the fourth character. Finally, this isolated exactly one binary: the real `/bin/base64`.

So, we finally got base64 of the flag which we can easily decode it.

And just like that… we captured the flag! 🎉
